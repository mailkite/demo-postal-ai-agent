// The other way to run the loop from the post: hand it to a managed route.
// Self-hosted Postal has no agent loop — you wire a model plus its send API yourself,
// on a server you also operate. On MailKite a route whose action is 'agent' runs the
// model turns for you on a durable queue, with a per-run transcript — no endpoint and
// no server to host. Run: `npm run route-demo`.
